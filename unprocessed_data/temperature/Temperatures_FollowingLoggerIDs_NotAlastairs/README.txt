These temperatures are taken directly from the data loggers.
I used the keys/IDs taken from the data logger,
which gives weird results since the thermocouple trees do not
seem to be evenly distributed in the compartment.

Since we know this is not the case (we always located the TC trees in the
centre and corners), I decided to use Alastair's distribution of
the TC trees. The problem is I don't know where that comes from.

In summary, the data in this folder is not used for the analysis.
